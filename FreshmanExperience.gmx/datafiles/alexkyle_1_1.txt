C:2|P:1|T:KYLE!
C:C|T:Enough jokes, do you two know anything? You were both in the lounge with everyone last night.
C:6|P:3|T:Now that I think it, I do recall hearing a scream last night, but I thought it was on my Discord server.
C:2|P:1|T:Yeah, I heard the same thing but I thought it was just coming...no I forget, sorry. Still tired. 
T:Had a big Robojackets meeting the other day and I had to finish some last minute stuff up before Motorama.
